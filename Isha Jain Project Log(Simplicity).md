This Wiki page contains information about how team implemented Extreme Programming(XP) value Simplicity during each week.

### Simplicity according to Extreme Programming (XP)
Simplicity is one of the core values of Extreme Programming. It focuses on-
* Using the simplest possible design to get the job done. 
* Delivering the simplest functionality that meets business needs. 
* Designing the simplest software that supports the needed functionality. 
* Building for today and not for tomorrow. 
* Writing code that is easy to read, understand, maintain and modify. 

## Week-1
Following the simplicity principle, my approach towards the project should be to make the whole development and integration process simple. Like before developing any functionality, I will gather all requirements and then will choose the most simple approach to develop it. Try to avoid additional functionalities that are not needed. Reduce the algorithm complexities, like preferring O(log n) over O(n). While testing also I will only consider testing just the required functionalities. In this way, we will minimize any unnecessary extra effort of development and testing. 
In the first week of our project, we need to finalize the project topic, and decide upon all the important and necessary features. I have gone through all probable features as mentioned in document, and then I sorted them based on simplicity. After that I explained those topics and probable challenges to the team.

## Week-2
This week, we have started building the base for the web application. But before that we need to divide the application in micro services, so that we can start building the basic services. And I suggested that we should focus on the basic features for now and try to keep it as simple as possible and later on if required we can add on more features to it.
One of my project mate suggested to start with the front end template first but I advised to build the base first so that we can add the front-end later as per our requirements. I have also given small hands on session for using Github via bash and gui to make github commit and update simple.
