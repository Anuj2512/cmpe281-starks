## Week 1

### What did the team do the past week?
* **Purvesh**: I worked on researching about the NoSQL database solutions for Product Catalog data, and technologies for developing server side code. Decided on the versions of the tools and technologies. Prepared the architecture diagram for the Product Catalog domain.
* **Anuj**: Researched on database technologies that is to be used. Decided server side language and web server. Designed architecture diagram for Shopping Cart domain.
* **Isha**: I did research on client and server side technologies. Database to be used for creating and maintaining user sessions and build the architecture to be followed for the same. 
* **Ritika**: I analyzed different technologies available in the market and came to a decision regarding the front-end and back-end development. Moreover, I finalized the cloud solution provider and NoSQL DB which would be a perfect fit to my domain.
* **Shantagouda**: Researched about NoSQL Graph database Neo4j and it's working with recommendations. Researched about algorithms to use in the recommendation engine. Researched various cloud hosting platforms and decided the cloud hosting platform to use for Recommendation Engine.
