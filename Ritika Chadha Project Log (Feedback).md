This Wiki page contains information about how team implemented XP Core Value, **Feedback** during each week.

In Extreme Programming, feedback can be of various forms: system and team. None of the team members "own" any code and hence, feedback on the other person's code is encouraged. System feedback can be obtained through testing the code and thereby, making the required changes to satisfy the output desired.

**Week 1**

* This week involved deciding on the vitals of the application which include different technologies, databases and programming languages to be used. Positive feedback about the services to be used led to a good and firm decision making process, providing clarity of thought to each team member. 

* The entire team pooled in their knowledge of the matter and gave in their invaluable suggestions and adapted any new changes based on the team's feedback.

* In the two meetings we had, extensive discussion took place about the domain, the appropriate cloud service provider and NoSQL Database to be used. For instance, initially, I had planned to work on Cassandra, however, on recommendation of one of the team members who would be achieving waste elimination for the team, I planned to opt for MongoDB after weighing in all the pros and cons.
