This Wiki page contains information about how team implemented XP Core Value, **Feedback** during each week.

In Extreme Programming, feedback can be of various forms: system and team. None of the team members "own" any code and hence, feedback on the other person's code is encouraged. System feedback can be obtained through testing the code and thereby, making the required changes to satisfy the output desired.

**Week 1**

* This week involved deciding on the vitals of the application which include different technologies, databases and programming languages to be used. Positive feedback about the services to be used led to a good and firm decision making process, providing clarity of thought to each team member. 

* The entire team pooled in their knowledge of the matter and gave in their invaluable suggestions and adapted any new changes based on the team's feedback.

* In the two meetings we had, extensive discussion took place about the domain, the appropriate cloud service provider and NoSQL Database to be used. For instance, initially, I had planned to work on Cassandra, however, on recommendation of one of the team members who would be achieving waste elimination for the team, I planned to opt for MongoDB after weighing in all the pros and cons.

**Week 2**

* The second week revolved around making decisions regarding the flow of data from the User Interface to the Database (Replicas) and the basic structural architecture to be adhered to. At first, it was suggested to initiate the code for the project from UI, however, feedback was incorporated that resulted in focussing more on the backend functionalities as suggested by the professor. 

* Each person brought onto the table the different stories or use cases of their domain and the understanding of their matter to which the other team members then added the extra input.

**Week 3**

* This week, the team was upto the task of resolving the inter-module dependencies. Each of the domain is dependent on the domain of the other team member. Utmost attention to detail was given to the functionalities that would be dependent on the other team member. 

* Positive feedback was delivered and accepted when it came to resolving the above mentioned. Moreover, changes were adopted according to the views of the others as well after the consensus of the entire team. This brought about a positive impact in aggregating the entire project.

**Week 4**

* In this week's meeting, the team was set upon the agenda of deciding upon the web-services to be implemented in order to handle the requests sent by the user, hitting the database. 

* A decorum of positive feedback mechanism was maintained. Through this system of listening, speaking and concluding all the valid points brought to the table, general consensus was met in inter-database access only through services. Such a decision would prevent breach of information and also maintain privacy.

**Week 5**

* This week, we came to common grounds of working on front-end technology and connecting it to our application. 

* It was ensured that each person's work and framework was taken into account before deciding upon the technology to be used. This was extremely essential since each person had different databases and programming languages that they were working on.

**Week 6**

* This week was one of the most crucial week for our development in terms of collaboration of our domains and also, hosting our database and code to the AWS server. We came to a general agreement of utilizing the AWS Ubuntu servers for this purpose.   Moreover, positive feedback was enrolled in order to sort out the cloud service provider to be chosen.
