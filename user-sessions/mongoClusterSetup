* Firstly, using my ami of mongoDB instance I created three more instances on AWS.
* Once three servers are up and running, make following entries in the host file '/etc/hosts' of all three instances:
  	
  	`127.0.0.1 localhost mongo0.usersession.com`
 +	
  	`10.0.1.74 mongo0.usersession.com`
 +	
  	`10.0.1.140 mongo1.usersession.com`
 +	
  	`10.0.1.56 mongo2.usersession.com`
  
 +  * Stop the MongoDB instance.
 +	* Open the configuration file /etc/mongod.conf.
 +	* Uncomment the line "Replication:" and add following line:
 +	replSetName: rs0
  
  
 * Perform the following commands to configure replica set:
 +	* rs.initiate()
 +	* rs.add("mongo1.example.com:27017")
 +	* rs.add("mongo2.example.com:27017")
 +
 +* To check the configuration of the replica set, use the following command:
 +	* rs.config()
